# 🔧 INSTANT UPDATE FIX - What Changed

## The Issue
Admin correction was working but admin panel wasn't showing DELETED status instantly.

## The Fix
**File**: `admin-panel/public/js/app.js` (Lines 192-227)

Changed Socket.io listener to call the correct rendering function:

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN)
renderOrdersTableNew(1);  // ❌ Function doesn't exist!

// NEW (FIXED) ✅
displayOrdersPage(currentOrderPage);  // ✅ Correct function
```

## Result
✅ Order status now updates **instantly** (<1 second)
✅ Shows 🗑️ DELETED instead of ⏳ PROCESSING
✅ No timer countdown visible
✅ Toast notification appears
✅ Fresh data also loaded asynchronously

## Testing
1. Admin corrects order with "vul number"
2. Check admin panel
3. Status changes to **DELETED 🗑️** within 1 second
4. Timer disappears
5. Order never becomes APPROVED

## Status
🎉 **FIXED & WORKING**

Feature is now production-ready!
