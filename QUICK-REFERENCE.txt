# 📋 QUICK REFERENCE - Admin Correction Feature

## 🎯 What It Does

Admin can correct PROCESSING orders by:
1. **Quoting** the order message
2. **Sending** a correction keyword
3. **Instant Result**: Order becomes DELETED 🗑️

---

## ⚡ Quick Example

```
USER:  87440444
       10

ADMIN: Done
       ➜ Order: PROCESSING ⏳ 1:50

ADMIN: [Quote order] vul number
       ➜ Order: DELETED 🗑️ (instant!)
```

---

## 🔑 Correction Keywords

Just use ANY of these:
- **vul** (Bengali)
- **mistake**
- **wrong**
- **cancel**
- **delete**
- **correction**
- **remove**
- **stop**
- **mistake hoise** (Bengali)
- **vul number** (Bengali)
- **wrong number**

*(Case-insensitive, can be part of longer text)*

## ✨ What Happens

```

        ↓
Bot IMMEDIATELY:
├─ Cancels 2-min timer

```
